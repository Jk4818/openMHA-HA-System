The configuration files in this directory, generic-hearing-aid,
combines plugins for calibration, adaptive differential microphones,
STFT processing, coherence filtering, a filterbank, dynamic compression,
and a pitch shifter. In combination this constitutes a generic hearing aid,
similar to example 4 but optimized for usage on portable hardware.
Some example settings for the dynamic compressor are also provided.

noedred/openMHAcontrol.flow provides a flow file for a node-red based GUI. 
The node 'node-red-dashboard' is required for this flow.

The processing is started like this:
mha ?read:generic-hearing-aid.cfg cmd=start

This example is originally provided with the Mahalia operating system for the Portable
Hearing Laboratory (PHL).

Usage in other contexts may require you to adapt the paths in the configuration files.
