This directory contains an example configuration and input sound
files which demonstrate how to use the ac_mul plugin.

For a general description of the ac_mul plugin, please refer to the
corresponding section in the openMHA_plugins.pdf manual.

example-frequency-shift-updown.cfg

example-frequency-shift-updown multiplies the input signal with a sinusoid
which outputs a mix of the up-shifted and the down-shifted input signal, where
the frequency shift equals the frequency of the multiplied sinusoid.  Refer to
the comments in the config file for more information.  They also contain
an exercise at the bottom of the file.
